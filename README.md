# SQL-Project---Parch-and-Posey
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Introduction
Parch and Posey is an hypothetical paper company, who specializes in the sales of quality paper types such as: Standard, Gloss and Poster.
The database consists of different tables linked with a database schema. To create a database from scratch and insert all tables, a prewritten
code can be found [here](https://github.com/NIYICODE/SQL-Project---Parch-and-Posey/blob/main/Parch%20and%20Posey%20Schema%20Word%20document.docx).

The first and only step you need is to create the database using the code 'CREATE DATABASE Parch_Posey'.

Then, copy the codes for the creation of different tables and run it in your SQL tool or IDE of choice (I used Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio for this project)

Using Transact-SQL, I demonstrated and explored different functional aspects of the Structured Query Language(SQL) from Basic to Advanced.
